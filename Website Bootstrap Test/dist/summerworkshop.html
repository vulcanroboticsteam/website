                <p>Vulcan Robotics is hosting a summer workshop at the San Mateo Public Library. It will be an opportunity for middle schoolers to explore engineering with several hands-on activities. Kids will have an opportunity to build structures that further their knowledge in structural integrity, design thinking, and cooperation. There will be four to five high school seniors supervising and advising anyone attending each day. Parents are welcome to stay at the library while the event is in session, but, since there is little space in the room, it would be best if parents could find somewhere else in the library to wait.</p>
                <p>Registration is required. Please call 522-7838 or come to the Children's Room at the San Mateo Public Library to register or get more information.</p>
