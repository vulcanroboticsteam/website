                <h1 class="page-header" >Overview</h1>
                <p>The Saratoga qualifier was our first ever! Unfortunately we had serious hardware and software issues. We ran out of time to complete our robot, so we hacked together a cardboard hopper. We weren't able to test our design with field elements, so we didn't realize that our hopper would be too far away from the goals to properly dump in them and quickly scrapped together a cardboard drawbridge in our pit at competition. We initially used 200lb fishing line for our drawer slides, but they broke during competition causing us to forfeit a match and chop a bolt in half!</p>
                <h4>Match 1</h4>
                <p>We ran our autonomous and raised the lift, could pick up balls, but couldn't dump them b/c gate stuck</p>
                <h4>Match 2</h4>
                <p>auton and then in tele op the auton ran again</p>
                <h4>Match 3</h4>
                <p>We were able to dump balls, but they all missed.</p>
                <h4>Match 4</h4>
                <p>Forfeited.</p>
                <h4>Match 5</h4>
                <p>controllers swapped for half the match and lost</p>
