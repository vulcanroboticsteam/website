                <p>We are a 5-person, first-year FTC team in San Mateo, California with an intense passion for robotics. Our team is fully student-run, meaning that students handle the design and building of the robot as well as our finances and logistics.</p>
                <p>We value simplicity and iterative design as our core design principles, aiming to have a working robot before every competition.</p>
